# Projects Directory

This directory contains project-related documentation, briefs, and planning materials for the SPNKr project.

## Structure

```
projects/
├── README.md           # This file - explains the projects directory
├── project-brief.md    # Main project brief and overview
├── roadmap.md          # Future development roadmap (if applicable)
├── architecture/       # Architecture decisions and diagrams (if needed)
├── research/          # Research notes and findings (if needed)
└── planning/          # Project planning documents (if needed)
```

## Purpose

This directory serves as a central location for:

- **Project Brief**: High-level overview of the SPNKr project goals and scope
- **Planning Documents**: Project roadmaps, feature planning, and development priorities  
- **Architecture**: Design decisions, system architecture, and technical planning
- **Research**: Investigation notes, API research, and technical findings
- **Documentation**: Project-specific documentation that doesn't fit in the main docs/ folder

## Guidelines

- Keep all project management and planning documents in this directory
- Use clear, descriptive filenames
- Maintain markdown format for consistency with the rest of the project
- Reference relevant files from the main README.md when appropriate
