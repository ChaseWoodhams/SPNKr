# SPNKr Project Brief

## Project Overview

**SPNKr** is an unofficial Python SDK for the Halo Infinite web API, designed to provide comprehensive access to Halo Infinite multiplayer data for analysis, statistics tracking, and application development.

## Project Goals

### Primary Objectives
- **Comprehensive API Coverage**: Provide access to all major Halo Infinite API endpoints
- **Developer-Friendly**: Offer an intuitive, well-documented Python interface
- **Type Safety**: Leverage Pydantic models for robust data validation and IDE support
- **Performance**: Implement async operations with built-in rate limiting
- **Reliability**: Maintain stable API with proper error handling and authentication flows

### Secondary Objectives
- **Film Analysis**: Enable detailed match replay analysis through theater mode data
- **Extensibility**: Support optional features like HTTP caching
- **Community**: Provide examples and tools for common use cases
- **Documentation**: Maintain comprehensive documentation for all features

## Target Audience

### Primary Users
- **Python Developers**: Building Halo Infinite statistics applications
- **Data Analysts**: Researching Halo Infinite matchmaking and player behavior
- **Community Tool Creators**: Developing clan management, tournament, or statistics tools
- **Academic Researchers**: Studying gaming data and player patterns

### Use Cases
- Player statistics tracking and analysis
- Clan/team performance monitoring  
- Tournament data collection
- Community website integration
- Academic research on gaming behavior
- Personal match history analysis

## Technical Architecture

### Core Components
1. **Authentication System**: Xbox Live → Halo Infinite token chain
2. **Service Layer**: Modular services for different API categories
3. **Data Models**: Pydantic models for type-safe data handling
4. **Client Interface**: Unified client with service access
5. **Film Analysis**: Theater mode data parsing and analysis
6. **Rate Limiting**: Built-in request throttling per service

### Key Technologies
- **Python 3.11+**: Modern Python with excellent async support
- **aiohttp**: Async HTTP client for API requests
- **Pydantic v2**: Data validation and serialization
- **asyncio**: Non-blocking operations for performance
- **Optional Caching**: aiohttp-client-cache integration

## Current Status

### Implemented Features
- ✅ Complete authentication flow (Xbox Live → Halo Infinite)
- ✅ All major API services (Profile, Stats, Skill, Discovery UGC, Economy, Game CMS)
- ✅ Comprehensive data models with type safety
- ✅ Film analysis for theater mode data
- ✅ Rate limiting and error handling
- ✅ Optional HTTP caching support
- ✅ Comprehensive documentation and examples
- ✅ Test suite with unit and integration tests

### API Coverage
- **ProfileService**: User profiles, gamertag/XUID lookup
- **StatsService**: Match history, service records, detailed match stats
- **SkillService**: CSR/MMR data, competitive rankings
- **DiscoveryUgcService**: User-generated content, asset search, film metadata
- **EconomyService**: Player customization data
- **GameCmsHacsService**: Medal metadata, season calendars, game images
- **Film Analysis**: Theater mode event parsing

## Project Constraints

### Technical Constraints
- **Unofficial API**: No official support or guarantees from Microsoft/343 Industries
- **Authentication Complexity**: Multi-step Xbox Live authentication required
- **Rate Limiting**: API has undocumented rate limits requiring careful throttling
- **Data Availability**: Some endpoints may have limited data or access restrictions

### Legal/Ethical Constraints
- **Terms of Service**: Must comply with Xbox Live and Halo Infinite ToS
- **Personal Credentials**: Users must provide their own authentication credentials
- **Responsible Usage**: Encourage responsible API usage to avoid service disruption
- **No Guarantees**: Clearly communicate unofficial status and potential risks

## Success Metrics

### Technical Metrics
- **API Coverage**: Maintain access to all major Halo Infinite endpoints
- **Reliability**: Handle authentication and API errors gracefully
- **Performance**: Efficient async operations with appropriate rate limiting
- **Type Safety**: Comprehensive Pydantic models for all API responses

### Community Metrics
- **Documentation Quality**: Clear, comprehensive documentation with examples
- **Developer Experience**: Intuitive API design with helpful error messages
- **Community Adoption**: Usage by developers building Halo Infinite tools
- **Contribution**: Community contributions and feedback incorporation

## Risk Management

### Technical Risks
- **API Changes**: Halo Infinite API may change without notice
- **Authentication Updates**: Xbox Live auth flow may be modified
- **Rate Limiting**: Undocumented limits may cause service disruption
- **Data Format Changes**: Response structures may change

### Mitigation Strategies
- **Comprehensive Testing**: Maintain test suite to catch breaking changes
- **Flexible Architecture**: Design for easy adaptation to API changes
- **Error Handling**: Robust error handling for various failure scenarios
- **Community Communication**: Clear documentation about unofficial status

## Future Considerations

### Potential Enhancements
- **Additional Endpoints**: Support for new Halo Infinite API endpoints as they become available
- **Enhanced Film Analysis**: More detailed theater mode data parsing
- **Performance Optimizations**: Further async and caching improvements
- **Community Tools**: Additional example scripts and utilities

### Maintenance Requirements
- **Dependency Updates**: Regular updates for security and performance
- **API Monitoring**: Watch for changes in Halo Infinite API behavior
- **Documentation Maintenance**: Keep documentation current with API changes
- **Community Support**: Respond to issues and feature requests

## Project Values

- **Transparency**: Clear communication about unofficial status and limitations
- **Quality**: High-quality code with comprehensive testing and documentation
- **Community**: Support developer community building Halo Infinite tools
- **Responsibility**: Encourage ethical usage and respect for game services
- **Innovation**: Enable creative applications and analysis of Halo Infinite data
